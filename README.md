R workflow for land use/ land-cover change analysis of Detroit

This is a term project I completed as part of my PhD coursework in the Fall of 2015.
It consists of a land cover analysis of the Detroit metropolitan region; specifically, the three Michigan counties of Oakland, Wayne, and Macomb.
I attempted to predict and explain land cover change using a Bayesian probabilistic network.

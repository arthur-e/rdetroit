# Background

There are many motivations for studying urban environments and urban change. Studies have focused on mitigating the impacts of urban sprawl [@Jantz2004], generating urban development scenarios [@Kocabas2007], or monitoring rates of urban growth and impervious surface increase [@Sexton2013].

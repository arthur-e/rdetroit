# Ongoing Work

- Check that normalized values make sense.
- Re-learn the network from discretized data???
- Check CPTs for explanatory relationships that make sense.

## Training

### Training Sample Composition

**November 25, 2014**
I used a random 1% of the combined 2001-2006 data to train both the expert and the learned network.

Next, I want to try:
- Using a much higher proportion of the data to train the network.
- 

### Resolution of Training Data

## Prediction

### Expert versus Learned Network

# Methods Used

## Learning the Network Structure

The network structure was learned using the complete 2001-2006 dataset. Most of the algorithms produced extremely dense graphs including complete graphs. Ultimately, the hybrid scoring and constraint algorithms, RSMAX2 and Max-Min Hill Climbing, produced the same network. The only change made to the learned network was reversing the directionality of the `pop.density` to `new` arc so that `new` was dependent on `pop.density`.
